<p>Add non-default constructors for <code>Gift</code> and <code>User</code>. ❌✔</p>
</li>
<li>Add unit tests to all projects except <strong>SecretSanta.Web</strong> and fully unit test the new classes in <strong>SecretSanta.Business</strong>(pending Thursday lecture). ❌✔</li>
<li>Refactor nullability setting into solution level <strong>props</strong> and <strong>targets</strong> files (pending Thursday lecture). ❌✔</li>
<li>Add the following list of code analysis assemblies and appropriately handle all warnings: <code>IntelliTectAnalyzer.dll</code>,<code>Microsoft.NetCore.Analyzers.dll</code>,<code>Microsoft.CodeQuality.Analyzers.dll</code>, and <code>Microsoft.NetCore.Analyzers.dll</code>. (Adding the IntelliTect one will automatically add the others since they are dependencies on the IntelliTect one.)</li>
<li>Refactor out a solution level global suppression file for disabling code analysis warnings across all projects (to do this add a reference to the same suppression file(s) from all projects). ❌✔</li>
<li>Configure Azure DevOps build for continuous integration to compile and run all unit tests ❌✔</li>
<li>If any updates occur in <strong>Assignment1</strong> prior to your PR, rebase onto <strong>Assignment1</strong>.
